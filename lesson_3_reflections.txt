When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  -- When I want to make sure it is backed up online
  -- When I want someone else to be able to work on it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  -- Because you may be working on changes that could be affected if you pull
