- Using diff or fc in windows for comparing two files
- is a great way to identify potential bugs.

- It may be that you created a typo that you weren't even 
- aware of, and diff or fc would show it too you.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programmer in the long term?

  - Obviously, knowing what changes you've made, allows you to roll
  - back any significant bugs you've introduced.
  
  - Also, you could use version control to understand how and what has
  - changed, especially if your working with other developers.
  
  - All of the following use version control - Wikepedia, Google DOC's, 
  - Dropbox
  
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in GIT, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs.

   - If you choose, then you can select reasonable times, for example
   - when it successfully compiles, or when the code is working
   
git log --stat /shows what files were changed in the commit, in the
               /repository
			   
git diff commit_id1 commit_id2   / show the diffs in the commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others like Google docs, treat
each file seperately?

   - because often a set of code changes that are logically related 
   - are across multiple files.

git --version  / tells you the version of Git
git clone repository_name / Copy an entire repository

git config --global color.ui auto

git log / shows all the changes to the repository (all commits)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?

   - git log shows you all commits
   - git diff commit_id1 commit_id2 shows you the differences 
   
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could
break something?

   -- If using often commits, I know I can always backtrack
   
What do you want to use Git for?

   -- Source code control..
   
git status   // list status of repository
